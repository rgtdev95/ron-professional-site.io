    question: "🔧 1. What drives you to build things?",
    answer:
      "I'm driven by the challenge of creating order out of chaos — transforming complex problems into solutions that feel simple, useful, and meaningful. For me, building isn't just about code or structure; it's about impact and clarity.",
  },
  {
    question: "🧩 2. How do you approach problem-solving?",
    answer:
      "I start by understanding the real issue — not just the symptoms. From there, I break complexity into smaller, logical parts until the path forward becomes clear. I enjoy the puzzle of figuring things out and making them flow seamlessly.",
  },
  {
    question: "💡 3. What's your favorite part of the development process?",
    answer:
      "That moment when everything clicks — when a messy concept becomes a clean, working system. It's the blend of logic, creativity, and discovery that keeps me hooked every time.",
  },
  {
    question: "⚙️ 4. What makes your work stand out?",
    answer:
      "I care deeply about the details — not just how things look, but how they work and feel. My focus is on creating systems that people actually enjoy using, not just ones that function.",
  },
  {
    question: "🚀 5. How do you stay curious and keep learning?",
    answer:
      "Curiosity drives everything I do. I experiment, break things, rebuild them, and learn from every iteration. Technology evolves fast, and I love the thrill of keeping up by creating, not just consuming.",
  },
  {
    question: "🤝 6. What's it like working with you?",
    answer:
      "I like to keep things clear, collaborative, and calm. I value honest communication, shared problem-solving, and making sure everyone feels confident about where the project is headed.",
