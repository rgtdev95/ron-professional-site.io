              I'm proud of creating order out of chaos — of taking complex, messy challenges and turning them into systems that actually make sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm proud of building tools and products that serve people in meaningful ways, not just because they work, but because they make someone's day a little easier.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm proud of staying curious — always learning, experimenting, and figuring things out until it clicks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of all, I'm proud of doing work that reflects care, clarity, and purpose.
